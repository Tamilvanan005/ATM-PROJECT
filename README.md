🏧 ATM Simulation with Twilio SMS Notifications
This project is a simple Python-based ATM simulation that allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. It integrates Twilio API to send SMS notifications for each action, enhancing user interaction with real-time alerts.

📌 Features
PIN-based authentication for basic security.

Menu-driven interface with 3 main options:

Check Balance – Displays and sends your account balance via SMS.

Withdraw Amount – Withdraws money (if sufficient funds) and sends the updated balance via SMS.

Deposit Amount – Deposits money (₹500 or more) and sends the updated balance via SMS.

Invalid PIN detection and SMS alert.

SMS alerts sent through the Twilio API.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python – Core language for the logic.

Twilio API – For sending SMS messages.

Command Line Interface (CLI) – For user input/output.

🔐 Security Notice
⚠️ Do not upload your Twilio credentials (SID and Token) in your public repository.
Use a .env file and keep it in .gitignore to prevent exposing sensitive information.

📦 Future Improvements
Encrypt PIN and handle secure input.

Add logging and transaction history.

Use GUI or web interface instead of CLI.

Integrate a real database for user data and balance tracking.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install Twilio: pip install twilio

Replace Twilio credentials and phone numbers.

Run the script using any Python environment or IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
